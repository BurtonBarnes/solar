# Solar
## Project Description
Solar energy is increasingly an important source of energy. This study is to determine what type of energy would be better for solar to generate. AC or DC?

## Project Goal
A study of solar energy in a single power station over time

## Initial Thoughts
I believe direct current would be better for solar energy

## The Plan

## Data Dictionary

| Feature | Definition |
|:--------|:-----------|
|PLANT_ID| The identification number for the plant|
|DC_POWER| The amount of DC power generated|
|AC_POWER| The amount of AC power generated|
|DAILY_YIELD| The total of AC and DC power generated|
|TOTAL_YIELD| The total yield that the plant has generated over its entire life|

## Exploration 
Study the data taken from kaggle and how it interacts with each other
### Summary
* Much more DC Power is generated than AC Power
* Most Days AC Power generated is 0
* Most Days DC Power generated is 0
* Total Yield peaks at 7,250,000
* Daily Yield is mostly 0 but is usally between 6000 and 8000
